# 2b2t new chunks - Meteor Client add-on

A Meteor Client add-on that shows new chunks on 2b2t.org.

### How it works
The module is under the "Render" category and is simply named "New Chunks".<br>
What it does is check for Copper Ore blocks over Y 0 in the overworld, which would mean the chunk was generated in 1.19 (post-update). For the nether, it checks for any Ancient Debris blocks.<br>
Disable the module to clear the new chunks' renders.
